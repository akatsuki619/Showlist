Fist time i use Retrofit.Before that i use HttpUrlConnection then JSONObject too much line of code to write.

Retrofit will save your development time, And also you can keep your code in developer friendly. Retrofit has given almost all the API's to make server call and to receive response. internally they also use GSON to do the parsing.
